This repo is created for the Kaggle competition: [Shelter Animal Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes)

Xgboost scored 0.73025.

It seemed that stacking random forest and xgboost predictions can greatly improve performance.
Current score: .69689.

Updated Modeltrain.R for ensembling.

Updated Clean.R: I think I calculated name and color frequency used combined train \& test data, which is a violation of the rule. Now updated using train data only. 

Updated clean_original.R: I actually ended up using this original feature set.
